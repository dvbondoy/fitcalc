# Android BMI Calculator

# Overview
BMI stands for Body Mass Index, which is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. The resulting number is then used to categorize a person's weight as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

BMI is a widely used method for assessing a person's body composition, and it is often used as a screening tool for health problems related to excess weight, such as heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. However, it is important to note that BMI is not a perfect measure of body fat, and it has limitations. For example, it may not accurately reflect body composition in athletes, older people, and others with a lot of muscle mass.

In general, a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal weight, a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight, and a BMI of 30 or above is considered obese. However, these categories are only general guidelines, and a healthcare professional should be consulted to determine if a person is at a healthy weight.
